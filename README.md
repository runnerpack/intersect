# Intersect #####

This Ruby extension is a port of the [CoffeeScript 2D intersection library] of the same name written by Github user [noonat]. It's my first C-extension, so be gentle!

It's pretty much a 1:1 port (so far) so I'll just point you at [his README] if you need usage instructions and (easily portable) example code. If it ever grows enough to require it, I'll add YARD docs and/or post stuff on the Wiki. Since noonat's latest commit was two years ago as I write this, I may eventually add the circle and plane (line?) tests he was preparing to add.

This extension is (currently) being developed on a 64-bit system running Windows 7 and Ruby 1.9.3 patch-level 374 from [RubyInstaller]. I would appreciate feedback and pull-requests from users of other systems and/or Ruby versions.
